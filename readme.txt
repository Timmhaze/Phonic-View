The application will alter its visuals between two states to represent the mood of the music. Soft, gentle sounds will
produce a blue and white aesthetic while aggressive or exciting ones will produce a red and black aesthetic.
The visuals displayed will reflect different aspects of the sound such as frequency spectrum, amplitude and peaks.
